# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to help Louise plan her campaign. We can make data and analyze the Kickstarter data file provided by using Excel.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

I created the extra column for the years using the "Year()" function basing on the Date Created Conversion column.  I made a pivot table using the Kickstarter data and filtered the Parent Category's and the years' column. I had the pivot tables to be filtered to include only the theater campaign from the Kickstarter data and by months. I made a line graph to present the number of successful, failed, or canceled projects. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

I used the new function, COUNTIFS(), to obtain the goal data for the plays subcategory. I filtered the Kickstarter data set using the "Countifs()" function to get the number of successful projects, failed projects, and canceled projects based on the goal amount. I also used the "Sum()" function to calculate the total of the project for each goal range. Then I made a line graph to display the percentage of successful and failed and canceled projects based on the project's goal amount.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Some challenges and difficulties that I encountered is making the graphs and inputting the correct formulas. I had a hard time getting the correct axes. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 

The two conclusions I can draw about the Outcomes based on the Launch Date is that the best time to launch is around May and June. The number of successful campaigns fluctuates from Jan to April. It then decreases from June to September. It goes back up in October, and then it declines to December. December is not a recommendable time to launch.  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

I can conclude that there are no direct correlations on the Outcome-based on Goals. There is some stability from goal 35000 to 39999 and  40000 to 44999. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Some limitations of this dataset are data could be incomplete. The location is so diverse and vague. It could produce more reliable data if the data provided where the campaign took place in the country. Possible inaccuracy with the formating or any duplicates values can influence the data collection.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Some possible tables/graphs we could create are

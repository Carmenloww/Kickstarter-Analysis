### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Some challenges and difficulties that I encountered is making the graphs and inputting the correct formulas. I had a hard time getting the correct axes. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 

The two conclusions I can draw about the Outcomes based on the Launch Date is that the best time to launch is around May and June. It then decreases from June to September. It goes back up in October, and then it declines to December. December is not a recommendable time to launch. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

I can conclude that there are no direct correlations on the Outcome-based on Goals. There is some stability from goal 35000 to 39999 and  40000 to 44999. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Some limitations of this dataset are data could be incomplete. The location is so diverse and vague. It could produce more reliable data if the data provided where the campaign took place in the country. Possible inaccuracy with the formating or any duplicates values can influence the data collection.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Some possible tables/graphs we could create are
